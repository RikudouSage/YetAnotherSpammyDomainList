See the file [domains.txt](domains.txt) for the domains. You can reference it raw, it includes one domain per row.

This is not intended to be used standalone but in combination with others, like [disposable/disposable-email-domains](https://github.com/disposable/disposable-email-domains) and [StopForumSpam](https://www.stopforumspam.com/downloads/toxic_domains_whole.txt).
